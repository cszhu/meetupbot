# meetupbot
The unofficial fb messenger bot for meetup api!

I decided to build a Facebook Messenger Bot for Meetup. It's very basic and uses the Meetup API and gives you a short list of Meetups that are happening in your area. In the future I hope to add additional features such as "Viewing More", adding images, and making the bot a bit more smart and responsive.
